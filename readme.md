ColdFusion CFC for Exceptional
==============================

ColdFusion exception-reporting client for [GetExceptional.com](http://getexceptional.com/).

Adapted from [Hoptoad CFC](https://github.com/shayne/coldfusion-hoptoad-notifier) by [Shayne Sweeney](http://github.com/shayne) and [Tim Blair](http://tim.bla.ir/).

------------------------------

The 'demo' folder includes some examples of how to make use of the CFC.  Use either the Application.cfc file alone or the combination of Application.cfm and onerror.cfm to enable the error catching.  The index.cfm will also come in handy if you need help generating an exception.
